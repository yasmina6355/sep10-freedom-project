## Context
During the last week, I've been researching and gathering information about the software and hardware technologies I discovered about Aricheture. I was on Google and my first search was Architecture hardware. I scrolled down and picked a website that looked reasonable to me. Eventually, I discovered [This website](https://www.eleganceinhardware.com/arch-hardware) which explains how Architect use a variety of gadgets, including cabinet hinges, table hardware, and inside sliding doors. These gadgets are made by major manufacturers such as Armac Martin, Accurate Lock and Hardware, and Baldwin. I discovered that having connections with these companies will offer you an advantage as an architect. So it's always beneficial to interact and create acquaintances in specific fields, such as architecture.I was searching Google for information on the types of gadgets that architects use. On my second Google search, I had some difficulty finding a useful website. I started by typing architectural devices into the search engine. That didn't provide me with the information I needed, so I used a second search engine: What kind of equipment do architects use? Than I stumbled across [This website](https://www.hellobonsai.com/blog/tools-that-architects-use) and discovered that architects use digital technologies to create detailed architectural models, visualizations, and animations that bring a project to life before building starts. Some of these digital tools include an electric eraser, a pen tablet, digital drawing tools, and architectural software. In addition, Artictects rely on physical tools. These technologies enable architects to create incredible designs and blueprints for the buildings and structures. Protective gloves, drafting paper, drafting tape, a compass, and precision knives are some of the essential tools used by architects. 

## Engineering Design Process.
I am currently in the second stage of the engineering design process, where the main goal is to research the problem. I plan on researching and gathering more information about how software and hardware technologies make up architecture. And informing people that architecture is an important factor in our society. It sets an environment for human activity, influencing how people live and interact with their surroundings. Good architecture makes our places come to life. The next stage is to brainstorm possible solutions, and I plan on gathering information and brainstorming possible solutions.

## Skills 

One skill I learned is how to find good websites. One tip is to make sure the website is recent or has been updated, or look for credentials or education of the website author. Definitely do not cite Wikipedia or similar user-edited sites. When I was trying to find a good website, I was looking for these qualities, making finding a good website easier.

Another skill I learned is how to incorporate the knowledge I gained from the website into a paragraph that is more detailed and provides detailed instructions on how I arrived at where I am now. When I was writing this blog, I learned how to summarize the main points of the website in order to write my content. Overall, writing is an important skill to have.

## Next Steps
I'm excited to come up with potential solutions for architecture.
