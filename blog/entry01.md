# Entry 1 Architecture
##### 10/14/24

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP10 is a year-long project all about making a website that informs the viewer of the current and future innovations in the topic of my choosing.

For my project, I chose the topic of Architecture because its my dream job. I liked creating and designing bulidings ever since I was little. My back up ideas were to create a website about either toy industries or chemistry. I didn't choose either because I wasn't passionate to create a website about them. 

I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Github. I also chose to independently study Architecture in order to help me make my website.

## Engineering Design Process
At this point in the engineering design process, defining the problem is the primary objective. My initiative aims to address the issue of presenting people with the true nature of architecture. The next step is to do some research on the topic. I want to talk to my peers and people in my immediate surrounds about the problem and get their opinions on it, in addition to using articles and websites.
## Skills 
Working on this blog has taught me several skills, such how to use Google, manage my time, and interact. Throughout the day, I have a ton of different activities. I just complete my schoolwork at night after finishing all of my other tasks since I have to create time for it. My experience with Google has increased as a result of working on this project, and I now find it easier to search for information that will be useful for my work. For this project, interacting is crucial since it will force me to step outside of my comfort zone and ask for help when I need it.
