# Entry 1 Architecture
##### 10/14/24

## Content
Since architecture is my ideal job, I decided to use it as the topic for my project. I chose this subject because I want to study about different styles of architecture, building techniques, and building procedures. I'm passionate about architecture and would like to know more about it. Since I was little, I have enjoyed designing and creating buildings. My backup plans included starting a website about chemistry or the toy industry. I wasn't passionate about making a website about them. Therefore, I  decided not to do it. 

## Engineering Design Process
At this point in the engineering design process, defining the problem is the primary objective. My initiative aims to address the issue of presenting people with the true nature of architecture. The next step is to do some research on the topic. I want to talk to my peers and people in my immediate surrounds about the problem and get their opinions on it, in addition to using articles and websites.
## Skills 
Working on this blog has taught me several skills, such how to use Google, manage my time, and interact. Throughout the day, I have a ton of different activities. I just complete my schoolwork at night after finishing all of my other tasks since I have to create time for it. My experience with Google has increased as a result of working on this project, and I now find it easier to search for information that will be useful for my work. For this project, interacting is crucial since it will force me to step outside of my comfort zone and ask for help when I need it.
